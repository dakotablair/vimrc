# Dakota's `.vimrc` #

My VIM customizations learned over time, collected and versioned.

## Sessions ##

Sessions are really useful. I like to make a session for any project I am
working in with `mks! .vim` in the project root directory. When I return to the
project, the session can be restored with `vim -S .vim`.
